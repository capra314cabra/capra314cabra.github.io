It&amp;rsquo;s very convenient to run interactively. But the same thing can be done with C#.
I will introduce how to do that.
What is an interactive form? When a user inputs a statement or expression, the tool evaluates it.
That is the simplest introduction I think.
In Python, it looks like this:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = 10 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a * a * 3.14 314.</description></item><item><title>[Today's C# tips] #2 Access private members</title><link>https://capra314cabra.github.io/en/posts/2020-04-10-csharptips2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 17:58:27 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://capra314cabra.github.io/en/posts/2020-04-10-csharptips2/</guid><description>I introduced C# Linq on the previous article #1.
Today&amp;rsquo;s theme is &amp;ldquo;Access private members&amp;rdquo;.
Attention This article will show you how to use System.Reflection to access private members. However, please do so at your own risk. (It&amp;rsquo;s not a dangerous operation, but if you do it for codes other people wrote, it can be a copyright infringement.)
I&amp;rsquo;ll show give a quiz to you! You have been given a variable of the following class.</description></item><item><title>[LLVM] How to show a float value by using printf</title><link>https://capra314cabra.github.io/en/posts/2020-04-09-llvm-printf-float/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 11:39:02 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://capra314cabra.github.io/en/posts/2020-04-09-llvm-printf-float/</guid><description>I will introduce how to generate LLVM IR that displays the float type variable by using LLVM&amp;rsquo;s C++ API.
My environment LLVM: LLVM 9.0.1 Compiler: cl.exe (included in Visual Studio 2019) What we want The goal of this time is to output an LLVM IR that behaves the same as the following C program. Add two float values together and do printf.

(Also I found it had been my fault, but you can be.)
The error that occurred First, let&amp;rsquo;s implement if statements frankly.
auto ifblock = llvm::BasicBlock::Create(module-&amp;gt;getContext(), &amp;#34;then&amp;#34;); auto mergeblock = llvm::BasicBlock::Create(module-&amp;gt;getContext(), &amp;#34;merged&amp;#34;); This is the part where we declare two Basic Blocks, one will be the inside of the if statement and the other will be the bottom of the end of the if statement.</description></item><item><title>Create a button whose background is filled by images on Avalonia UI</title><link>https://capra314cabra.github.io/en/posts/2020-03-29-avalonia-image-button/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2020 11:34:47 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://capra314cabra.github.io/en/posts/2020-03-29-avalonia-image-button/</guid><description>On this article, I will describe how to create a button whose background is filled by images on a crossplatform GUI library, Avalonia UI.
I had a harder time to make it than I had expected. I beleive that this saves your time.
Precondition You have an Avalonia project already. You have finished to choose images to use already. I recommend you to prepare three images, normal, hovering, clicking.</description></item><item><title>[Today's C# tips] #1 Operate arrays like SQL</title><link>https://capra314cabra.github.io/en/posts/2020-03-20-onepoint-csharp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2020 14:15:06 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://capra314cabra.github.io/en/posts/2020-03-20-onepoint-csharp/</guid><description>C# is not useful than Java.

Well&amp;hellip; C#? Is it used to call Win API&amp;hellip;?
These are what I have really been told about C#.
When I listened them, I realized that many people haven&amp;rsquo;t ever touched C# yet. Indeed, there are situations where you should not use C#. I think, however, there should be much more people who use C# even considering it.</description></item><item><title>Install lli, a tool of LLVM, to Windows</title><link>https://capra314cabra.github.io/en/posts/llvm-lli-install/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Mar 2020 09:12:43 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://capra314cabra.github.io/en/posts/llvm-lli-install/</guid><description>Good morning! I&amp;rsquo;m capra314cabra, who am under making new language.
On this article, I will tell you how to get tools of LLVM. You might think it should be easy but I felt not. I hope you read this and save huge amount of time from reading heap of documents.
TL;DR At last, I downloaded and built all the code of LLVM on my PC. And I got tools of LLVM, including lli.</description></item><item><title>How to use 'sudo' in Powershell</title><link>https://capra314cabra.github.io/en/posts/powershell-sudo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 10:47:01 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://capra314cabra.github.io/en/posts/powershell-sudo/</guid><description>In this article, I will explain how to implement a command like sudo on Powershell.
On Powershell, there are no command with which you can run other commands as a administrator. And if you want to do something as a administrator, you have to open a administrator&amp;rsquo;s Powershell by GUI.
It&amp;rsquo;s troublesome! I wish we always want to do everything on CUI!
I hope this article helps many people.
Plan Implement a function that is similar to sudo and set it as a Powershell alias.</description></item></channel></rss>
