It&amp;rsquo;s very convenient to run interactively. But the same thing can be done with C#.
I will introduce how to do that.
What is an interactive form? When a user inputs a statement or expression, the tool evaluates it.
That is the simplest introduction I think.
In Python, it looks like this:

Why don&amp;rsquo;t we use Java, which runs on 3 billion devices!
