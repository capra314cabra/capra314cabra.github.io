On Powershell, there are no command with which you can run other commands as a administrator. And if you want to do something as a administrator, you have to open a administrator&amp;rsquo;s Powershell by GUI.
It&amp;rsquo;s troublesome! I wish we always want to do everything on CUI!
I hope this article helps many people.
Plan Implement a function that is similar to sudo and set it as a Powershell alias.</description></item></channel></rss>
